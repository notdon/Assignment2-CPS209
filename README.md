First of all, this is the one of the most advance assignment that I did. All of the required functionality is almost working. I also tried to understand some helpful classes that the professor provides, but it's not really sufficient so I decided to make my own classes but the draw method is simply based on the 'helpful' class, I just expand it and add some method to make my work easier. Mostly setter and getter methods and methods that return true or false, just to make my work easier

Moreover, I created an abstract class Vehicle. Based on that we can create the Train, the trailer, stack boxes. after all the unimplemented methods is generated inside each class. Then, I override the methods depends on the class. 

One thing to note here is I use Timer Listener in my panel class, for some reason the panel does not work and draw anything if i did not use timer listener, I got the answer using timer listener when searching through stack exchange and see some other example programs. but basically from what i the timer listener is to update the linking GUI between the trailer, the lines between the trailers or the location of any of the object is to be repainted when they are updated. Also one functionalities that sometimes work is Queue add and remove method for the stackboxes. Sometime it works some it does not, however if you drag the trailer to desired boxes, it will add them.
