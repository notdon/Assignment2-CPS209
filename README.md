# Assignment2-CPS209


This is assignment 2 for CPS 209 Ryerson University. This assignment aims to make an understanding of Java Data Structure.
We practiced LinkedList in this assignment. In order to run the program, you just need to click the jar file. All of the above are the source code in order to run the program.

First of all, this is the one of the most advance assignment that I did. All of the required functionality is working except remove last, I'm not sure I understand what is the algorithm for removelast method works. I also tried to understand some helpful classes that the professor provided, but it's not really sufficient so I decided to make my own classes but the draw method is simply based on the 'helpful' class, I just expand it and add some method to make my work easier.
